## File Structure
All images, css, and js files are organized within their respective folders inside of the assets folder. The only files are that not in folders are the html pages and the main css stylesheet for quicker access.

# Developer Manual
## How to Install Application & All Dependencies
1. Clone this repository by selecting the green “Code” button and “Open with Github Desktop”.
2. In Github Desktop, select “Open in Visual Studio Code” or text editor of your choice.

## How to Run Application on a Server
1. In VSCode, right-click on any of the html pages you want to view.
2. Select “Copy path”, and paste the path into your browser.
3. If you want to view the changes you made to the code, be sure to save the changes to the file (CTRL+S) on VSCode and then refresh the browser (CTRL+R).

## How to Run Tests for the Software
There is no prewritten tests in this repository. Testing was mainly done through viewing the page locally on a browser and inspecting the page to look at the responsiveness of the website.

## Known Issues
* The filter and search function on the resources page only works on the page of the pagination. 
* On the Home page when a user clicks on a pillar it does not do anything (implement a filter function when a user clicks on a pillar).
* The images used for each page are specifically cropped the same size so that they match. If you plan on replacing the images, make sure that they fit the same dimensions as the current images or else the formatting will be uneven on the page.

## Future Development
This is a list of what needs to be improved on the current state of the website, as well as ideas that can be worth implementing in the future.

**Home (index.html):**
* Have detailed descriptions of what each pillar means within each card
* Link the cards to a new page or to the resources page but already filtered
* Replace stock images with content that is specifically from the community and/or university

**Career Services (careerservices.html):**
* None of the buttons are linked. Be sure to get that information.
* Contact information and office hours are filler text. Be sure to get that information.

**Resources (resources.html):**
* Continue to add individual resources provided by UMD Inclusive Impact (POC: Sammy Popat, David Steele)
* Change the card photos to a photo from the organization instead of using stock images
* Determine if the client would like to have mini descriptions of each resource or just a “learn more” button
* Fix the filter and search function

**Find Events (findevents.html):**
* Create one big calendar that updates based on the other calendars given (Prince George’s calendar, UMD calendar, etc.)
* Have a short description of what the calendar does
* Create a key to help distinguish which event on the calendar corresponds to the community


**About (about.html):**
* The page looks good but if you would like to improve the aesthetic of the page (colors, pictures, etc.)
* If there are new partners add them here

**Other Suggestions:**
* Individual pages for each pillar with more details
* Add or takeaway translate languages based on client needs
* Add a search function for all pages
* Fix formatting if needed (the resource page may have some formatting errors)
